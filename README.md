#### whiskers was born out of my experience moderating very active Discord servers.
#### Initially, she was designed to prevent drama and give the moderators a little peace of mind.
#### But her scope has expanded, thanks to the testing and feedback from her dedicated users.
#### As long as she continues to receive feedback, I will continue to update her.

## Democracy! ‚úã
* Propose ideas to the #mod-vote channel with a simple command  
* Upon reaching the upvote threshold it is announced as a "Success"
* Upon reaching the downvote threshold it is announced as a "Failure"
* Suggestions in #feedback (for non-mods) that reach the upvote threshold progress to #mod-vote as "petitions"  
* From my experience, even combative mods will accept a result that is automatically posted
* Due process means everything - hold the mod team accountable
 
## Damage Control üî•
* Messages with X :report: reactions are automatically deleted and archived in #report-log (with image retention)
* Auto-mute reported users for a customizable number of seconds
* Auto-moderate channels alongside customizable metrics such as NSFW or toxicity
* The intelligent automod learns through Google's PerspectiveAPI
* Turn on one of two lockdown modes to auto-kick or auto-ban raiders
* Enable autorole, and optionally require newly created accounts to input a verification password (anti-alt)
  
## The Embassy (NEW!) üåø
* The embassy is a chat channel shared between two servers.
* Once you set up the embassy channel, set its description to the ID of the foreign server
* If both server embassy descriptions are set to the other server's ID...
* ...Then any messages sent on either embassy will be sent to the other one.
* Use it for diplomacy, inter-server events, or even just plain fun!
* It is secure, as the IDs have to be mutually set
  
## Utility üîé
* Auto-display the number of online users with a simple üî∫ prefix on a channel or category name  
* Analyze the chance of an announcement to be negatively percieved before sending it 
* Translate messages in dozens of languages from Welsh to Arabic to Yiddish to Tagalog
* Give distinguished users a command to ping mods with a canned alert
* Uses Google Cloud Vision to analyze the contents of an image, including grabbing text from images
* Want to find out what that strange image is? With a simple command, do a Google reverse-image search

## And More üìã
* Generate meme captions for images
* Kick, ban, unban, role, and timed mute commands 
* Custom prefixes!
* A super sexy bot page
* A support server manned by my bro LunarShadows

## Coming soon!
- Google Cloud Vision anti-nsfw image filtering
- natural.js machine-learning word censorship
- Auto-generated external IP verification pages for banned users making an appeal
- Auto-translator-to-English in channels where it is enabled
